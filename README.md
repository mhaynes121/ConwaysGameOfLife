<h1>Conway's Game of Life</h1>
My attempt at Conway's Game of Life.
<br/>
You can find details about the game as a whole here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life.
<br/><br/>
Here are the rules that determine what happens in the game in general: <br />
<list>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li> 
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li> 
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li> 
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li> 
</list>
