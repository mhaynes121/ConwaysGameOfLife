My attempt at Conway's Game of Life. 
You can find details about the game as a whole here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
Here are the rules that determine what happens in the game in general:
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
